### Code: "Revenue Decline Simulator"

This code simulates the revenue decline of a company over time, calculates the operating income each year, and determines the year when the company will start making a loss.

#### Code Explanation:

```python
# Revenue and Expenses
revenue = 1000000  # Initial revenue
expense = 1000000  # Fixed expenses
year = 0  # Year counter

# Decrease revenue by 20% each year until operating income becomes negative
while revenue > expense:
    year += 1
    revenue *= 0.8  # Decrease revenue by 20%
    operating_income = revenue - expense  # Calculate operating income
    print(f"Year {year}: Revenue = {revenue}, Operating Income = {operating_income}")

print(f"The company will start making a loss after {year} years.")
```

#### Explanation of Each Part:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `revenue = 1000000`: The starting revenue of the company is set to 1,000,000 dollars.
   - `expense = 1000000`: Fixed expenses are also set to 1,000,000 dollars, meaning the operating expenses do not change.
   - `year = 0`: Initializes a counter to keep track of the number of years.

2. **While Loop**:
   - The loop runs as long as the revenue is greater than the expenses.
   - Each year, `revenue` is reduced by 20% (`revenue *= 0.8`), simulating a 20% annual revenue decline.

3. **Operating Income Calculation**:
   - Each year, `operating_income` is calculated by subtracting `expense` from `revenue`.
   - This value is printed along with the year, displaying the revenue and operating income for that year.

4. **Exit Condition**:
   - When `revenue` decreases to a point where itâ€™s less than `expense`, the loop stops.
   - The program then prints the total number of years it took for the company to start making a loss.

#### Example Output:

Assuming an initial revenue of 1,000,000 and expenses of 1,000,000, the code would output something like:

```
Year 1: Revenue = 800000.0, Operating Income = -200000.0
The company will start making a loss after 1 years.
```

This indicates that the company will start incurring a loss after 1 year if the revenue keeps decreasing at the same rate.
